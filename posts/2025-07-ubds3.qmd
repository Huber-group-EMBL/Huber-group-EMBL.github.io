From 19 July till 1 August 2025, [we](https://www.bds3.org/our-team) organized the third edition of the [Ukrainian Biological Data Science Summer School](https://www.bds3.org) (UBDS$^\textsf{3}$). Now taking place for the third time (links to posts on [first](2023-07-ubds3.html) and [second](2024-07-ubds3.html) editions), the summer school has created a sense of community: young people eager to learn, expand their scope, network across the country and around the world. Students from the first or second year coming back as tutors, seeing how science is a positive and optimistic force. Also, how it goes together with strong civil society: many students engaged in the [demonstrations against corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_anti-corruption_protests_in_Ukraine) that swept Ukraine during the time of the summer school. UBDS$^\textsf{3}$ also partly inspired a sister event [CRABS](https://crabs.kse.ua/), which took place two weeks later in Kyiv for the first time.

Many thanks to our fantastic local hosts at Uzhhorod National University, including Yevheniia Haiovych, Oleksii Kurutsa and Serhii Vronskiy at the Information Technologies Centre!
