Announcing [Bioinformatics For Ukraine](http://bioinformaticsforukraine.com), a beacon of hope and support for Ukrainian scientists and students whose lives have been deeply affected by the ongoing Russian aggression.

Imagine being a student or researcher passionate about bioinformatics, on the cusp of breakthroughs and discoveries, only to have your dreams and hard work halted by war. This is the situation for many in Ukraine today. Amidst these challenges, our initiative offers a ray of hope.

Each donation, no matter the size, has the power to change the trajectory of someone's life. Your contribution can help us provide essential resources, mentorship, and opportunities to those struggling to continue their education and research in these challenging times.

What Your Donation Means

- A Safe Haven for Learning: we create scholarships for outstanding students so that they can focus on studying and doing research: \$500/month (\$6,000/year) will support one student.
- Mentorship and Research opportunities: Connecting students with global experts in bioinformatics and involving them in cutting-edge projects in bioinformatics and genomics. 

You can check the stories of students affected by war here: <http://bioinformaticsforukraine.com/students-stories/>.
Over 40 students, whose education was disrupted by the war, found new hope through this initiative. With the support of donors like you, they were able to continue their studies and be involved in cutting-edge bioinformatics research in Ukraine and abroad. Anastasiia Boshtova, a fellow of Bioinformatics for Ukraine, was awarded a scholarship by Oxford University to pursue her Master's Degree in Bioinformatics.
