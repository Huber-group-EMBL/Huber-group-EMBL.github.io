There are two major types of approaches in bioinformatics:

- there is a cool new method (maybe you invented/wrote it), and now you want to figure out what it can do with your data. The more sophisticated, the better. **The hammer looking for a nail.**
- there is a cool new dataset, and a scientific question, and now you look for the most straightforward and robust way to answer the question. If this is simply done by a good visualisation and a t-test, so be it. **The problem solver.**
