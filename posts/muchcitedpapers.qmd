Nature published, in April 2025, two meta-analyses of

  (a) the [top 100 papers of all time](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-01124-w)
  (b) the [top 25 papers of this century](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-01125-9)

Out of EMBL, we have 

 - [the DESeq2 paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8), which is on Rank 26 in (a) and Rank 18 in (b)
 - [the CLUSTAL W paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/22.22.4673), on Rank 37 in (a).

The actual data are, as usual, in the Supplement files:
