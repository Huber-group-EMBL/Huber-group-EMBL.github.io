Hugo is originally an evolutionary biologist who fell in love with R and R
package development during his PhD at the University of Montpellier.

After this PhD, he started working as a Research Software Engineer to build
tools for other researchers. He has since then worked in many different
domains, including ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology. During this
time, he has strived to contribute to the wider R community and open-source
community by contributing to infrastructure and development tooling.

He joined the team in August 2025 to maintain and develop bioconductor R
packages.
