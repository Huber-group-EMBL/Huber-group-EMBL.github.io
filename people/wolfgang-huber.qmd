Wolfgang works as a research group leader. He enjoys exploring new datasets, developing statistical methods, and discovering new biological insights. Trained in theoretical physics, he now considers himself a statistician. He works with a brilliant team of master students, PhD candidates, postdocs and staff scientists, with outstanding colleagues at EMBL and with an international network of collaborators. When he is not working on science, he likes to spend time with his two sons, or biking up the hills around Heidelberg and elsewhere.

Wolfgang is an EMBL Senior Scientist, co-director of the \[Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit\], a joint venture between the Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg and EMBL, co-head of the [Theory Transversal Theme](https://www.embl.org/about/programme/research-plans/theory-at-embl) at EMBL, and co-head of EMBL's [Open Science](https://www.embl.org/about/open-science) and [Responsible Research Assessment](https://www.embl.org/about/research-assessment) working groups.

He is a founding member of \[Bioconductor\], a large, collaborative, international open-source software project for the analysis and comprehension of biological data. He is also a fellow of the [International Society for Computational Biology](https://www.iscb.org), an elected Member of the [European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)](https://www.embo.org), and a fellow of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](https://ellis.eu) and a member of [its Heidelberg unit](https://ellis.eu/units/heidelberg).

He received a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Freiburg, Germany, in 1998 for work on master equation models and their numerical simulation, with applications in biology and in quantum optics.

He conducted postdoctoral research in cheminformatics at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California in 1998-99. He switched to bioinformatics and cancer transcriptomics for a second postdoc at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Germany, in 2000-04.

He started a research group at [EMBL-EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) in beautiful Cambridge, UK, in 2004.

In 2009, he joined the new Genome Biology unit at EMBL Heidelberg.

With Susan Holmes, he co-wrote the textbook [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/).

Wolfgang is interested in open source software community building, and engages in courses, workshops and consortia that help drive these. He is also deeply committed to cross-disciplinary scientific training: teaching biologists and medical researchers in statistics, computation and AI, and teaching computational scientists in biological applications and data generating technologies.
