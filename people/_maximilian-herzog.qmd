Maxi is currently visiting the Huber Group via the Theory@EMBL fellowship programme. He is curious to learn about and refine existing computational methods in single-cell and spatial omics data analysis. 

He holds a Masters's degree in Physics from Heidelberg University, where he mainly worked on the relation between MCMC-related methods, thermodynamics and information geometry.
