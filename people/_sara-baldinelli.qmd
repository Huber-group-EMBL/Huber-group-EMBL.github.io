Sara is a Master's student in Quantitative and Computational Biology. For her Master's thesis, she is working with the Huber group, performing data analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbation data generated from in vivo Cas9, applied to the Drosophila melanogaster midgut as part of the ERC DECODE project.

She holds a Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics from La Sapienza University, Rome. In 2022-23, she completed an internship at the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, where she worked on whole-transcriptome profiling of osteosarcoma through microenvironment deconvolution and network analysis.
