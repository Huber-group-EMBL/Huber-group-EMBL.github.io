Florian is a postdoctoral fellow with [Dr. Aur√©lie Ernst](https://www.dkfz.de/en/genome-instability-in-tumors) at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in collaboration with the Huber group.
His current research focuses on computational methods for the detection of chromosomal instability from omics data of pre-cancer tissue.

Previously, Florian obtained a PhD in computer science from [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/), where his research focused on machine learning based methods for robust geometric model fitting in computer vision.
