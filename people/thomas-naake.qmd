Thomas is a Postdoctoral Fellow who employs statistical methods to unravel
the intricacies of cancer biology. His primary focus is to enhance predictions
of cancer recurrence across diverse cancer types using
metabolomics and proteomics data sets. He is also developing novel tools
that increase the robustness and interpretability of these data types.

Prior to joining the group in November 2020, he did his PhD in Biochemistry at the 
Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam. Thomas holds
an M.Sc. in Molecular Biotechnology from the University of Heidelberg and a 
B.Sc. in Environmental Natural Sciences from the University of Freiburg. 
In his free time, he enjoys traveling, doing sports, and learning new languages.
