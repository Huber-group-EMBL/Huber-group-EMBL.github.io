Thomas is a Postdoctoral Fellow who employs statistical methods to
unravel the intricacies of cancer biology. His primary focus is to
enhance predictions of cancer recurrence across diverse cancer types
using metabolomics and proteomics data sets. He is also developing novel
tools that increase the robustness and interpretability of these data
types.

Prior to joining the group in November 2020, he did his PhD in
Biochemistry at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology
in Potsdam. Thomas holds an M.Sc. in Molecular Biotechnology from the
University of Heidelberg and a B.Sc. in Environmental Natural Sciences
from the University of Freiburg. In his free time, he enjoys traveling,
doing sports, and learning new languages.
