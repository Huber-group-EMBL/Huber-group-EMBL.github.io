#### Scope

The conference "Statistical and AI methods for multi-modal multi-scale modeling of biological systems" will address critical challenges in integrating and interpreting vast multi-modal datasets across different biological scales. This conference builds on a successful series of previous meetings at the Congressi Stefano Franscini, which have attracted top international experts from leading institutions globally.

The event will bring together leading researchers from fields such as statistics, artificial intelligence (AI), molecular biology, and biomedicine to explore cutting-edge methods for analyzing complex biological systems. Key topics will include multi-modal data integration, the use of deep learning and AI for high-dimensional data interpretation, and multi-scale modeling of biological processes. The conference will also cover AI's role in understanding dynamic biological systems and its potential to transform experimental design.

We aim to foster collaboration between quantitative researchers and biologists, providing a platform for interdisciplinary exchanges. Early-career scientists will be strongly encouraged to participate, with dedicated opportunities for poster presentations and contributed talks. This conference will not only showcase the latest advancements in AI and statistical modeling for biology but also pave the way for new research partnerships and innovations, helping to shape the future of biological research globally.
The conference will be a forum for exploring the potential of AI in revolutionizing biological research and will facilitate collaborations that bridge traditional statistical methods with novel AI approaches. The event will offer networking opportunities, contributing to the continued growth of computational biology and AI-driven scientific discoveries.

These questions will be explored by an interdisciplinary group of speakers and participants.

# The argument 'escape=FALSE' for 'kable' makes sure that the HTML tags are interpreted, i.e., that, e.g., < is not converted to &lt; and > to &gt;.
# This works, but unfortunately, kableExtra::collapse_rows does not have such an argument, and still performs exactly that conversion.
# The last line below is a hack to revert that.
